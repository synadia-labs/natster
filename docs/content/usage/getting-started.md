Natster doesn't require much at all from its users. Before moving to the installation section, you will need a Synadia Cloud account. You can sign up for a free account with no commitments. 

Synadia Cloud is a globally hosted, managed NATS cluster that gives distributed applications an unmatched foundation on which to build.

Go to [cloud.synadia.com](https://cloud.synadia.com) to register and create a new account. Once you've done that, move on to the Installation guide.
